# clemsonDiscoveryTool
My CPSC3600 class developed and contributed this project -   a UDP-based  discovery program.

Please contact Dr Jim Martin at jmarty@clemson.edu for questions/issues.

As of 2/16/2020 -  this tool is under development. It will be finished by 5/15/2020. 
The initial code  is a simple UDPEcho (or UDPPing) tool. 


Go Tigers!
